* **Firebase integration:** Stores user and session data.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
* **Redis**
  Install Redis locally or use a hosted instance. For local installation:

  * On macOS: `brew install redis`
  * On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install redis-server`
  * On Windows: [Download from Redis official site](https://redis.io/download)
* **Firebase Service Account JSON** (see SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS below)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd CANVuS
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables in `.env`:

   ```env
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS=/path/to/serviceAccountKey.json
   REDIS_URL=<your-redis-url>
   ```
   (Optional): Generate a secure JWT secret using the included script:

   ```bash
   node crypt.js
    ```
4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. Open the front-end in your browser to access the canvas.

### Set up Firebase project

1. Go to [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project.
3. Add a web app and generate a Service Account JSON for Admin SDK.
4. Save the JSON locally and set the path in your `.env` as `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS`.

### SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS

Path to your Firebase Service Account JSON file, which contains:

* `project_id`
* `private_key`
* `client_email`
* Other credentials required for Firebase Admin SDK access

## Usage

* Use the toolbar to:

  * Draw or erase
  * Pick colors using the color picker
  
* Owners of shared canvases have control over session management.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
* **Real-time updates:** WebSockets (Socket.IO)

* **Authentication:** OAuth2 + JWT
* **Database:** Firebase for session and canvas state
* **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JS (Canvas API)
